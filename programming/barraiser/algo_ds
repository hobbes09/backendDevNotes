Design a car selling chain dealership with the following characteristics :
- The chain consists of many stores
- Each store is located in a particular state. Eg : Maharastra, Karnataka, etc
- Each store sells number of cars
- A car is characterised  by Company Brand (BMW, Mercedes, Audi, etc),
Model number (ABC123, ASD12, etc) and color (White, Black, Red, etc).
- Each store sells only a sebset of all possible cars
- Nature of queries ::
1) Fetch all stores that sells car of a particular type
2) For a given location, find cars of a particular type


You have built an online dictionary website. A user can enter a word and the website responds with the meaning of the word.
In the backend, build a function that can get a stream of these queried words and always display the top 5 searched words.



Free-Wifi Service in Airports have capabilities to track users and their devices.
They use this information to limit the internet access upto a certain limit.

Design a free-wifi service in an airport that has the following restrictions :
1) A user (identified by a phone number) can login a maximum of 3 times per hour.
2) A user can connect to a maximum of 2 concurrent devices at a time.

Problems :
1) Create a service that allow a user login implementing the mentioned restrictions.
Use language data structures to any kind of storage requirements.

University servers have capabilities to track users and their devices and all user activity.
They use this information to limit user access to download research articles from university database.

Design a downloader service in the university server application that has the following restrictions :
1) A user (identified by a phone number) can download a maximum of 100 articles per hour.
2) A user can connect to a maximum of 2 concurrent devices at a time.

Problems :
1) Create a service that allow a user to trigger download after checking the above restrictions are not violated.
Use language data structures to any kind of storage requirements.

Implement a message broker using Golang.
Functionalities expected :
- The MB in this context is a single queue with fixed size and needs to be of blocking nature.
- If the capacity of the queue is 'C', then push/add to the queue after C elements should be blocked (or wait till one slot is free)
- If the capacity of the queue is 'C', then pop/pull/remove out of the queue while having 0 elements should be blocked (or wait till one slot is available)
- If multiple consumers (threads) are consuming from the MB, then ordering is not expected.
- The nature of the data in the MB, can be a simple struct with content (id int, and text string)

The Producer:
- Its an async collection of process, that pushes data into the MB

The Consumer :
- Its an async collection of process, that pulls data into the MB

Questions :

1) How are implemneting the blocking and threads waiting feature in the MB ?
Hint : In golang, think of something that has this feature
Hint : Use standard push and pull features of channel
Hint : If channel is full or empty, there is already a waiting behaviour


2) Can you summarise the MB behaviour ?

3) What all primary methods will be required in the MB class ?

# A backend service is receiving events of user activity from a stream.
# The user activity event looks like ::
# {userId: "u1", "date": "01-01-2022", "time": "0900"}

# Given a list of such user activity events, return the top K active users.
# The most active users have the most frequent number of events.

# Eg :
# {userId: "u1", "date": "01-01-2022", "time": "0900"}
# {userId: "u2", "date": "01-01-2022", "time": "0901"}
# {userId: "u1", "date": "01-01-2022", "time": "0902"}
# {userId: "u1", "date": "01-01-2022", "time": "0903"}
# {userId: "u2", "date": "01-01-2022", "time": "0904"}
# {userId: "u3", "date": "01-01-2022", "time": "0905"}

# K = 2

# The output = {u1, u2}

Design StackOverFlow where users can post and discuss technical problems within
a community.
- Users should be able to post Questions into the platform
- Question posted by a user has a title, description and any number of tags.
- Users can also post an answer to a question,
- Users can also comment on either the question, or any answer posted, or any of the other comments
- Posts are searchable by both tags and text of the title of the question.
For tags search, all of the search tags should be present in the question.
- Notifications::
  - Trigger notif to the original author for any answer or comment.

A hospital issues token for its patients that wants medical consultation from doctors.
There are however, some limitations on the tokens assigned ::
1) X tokens can be generated every Y hours
2) If the token is not used, it gets expired in Z hours
3) Total number of tokens in a day should not exceed C count
4) One person can have only 1 token at a time

Create a function getToken(personId, timeInDateHourFormat) that issues token to a person.

5) Create an appointment processor function that processes the tokens (takes token number as input and marks it as 'processed'). IF we add a further condition that a
token T1, needs to be processed between A1 and B1 time intervals. However, if its a "premium" token, it can be processed anytime, given its not expired.

There is an online multiplayer game where multiple people can play simultaniously.
Every time a player scores, an event is generated and sent to the backend service.
Thus the backend receives a continuous stream of events of the form :

Event = (time, userId, score).

Given these information, develop solutions to ::
1) Calculate the sum of scores (across all players) for last 1 hour
2) Top scoring player in the last N, constant hours
3) Most frequently scoring player in last M, constant hour

Desighn a movie ticket reservation system like BookMyShow.
Auditoriums are phylical places where movies are shown.
Each movie presentation is called a screening.
Screening is showing of a particular movie in a particular auditoium at a particular time.
A movie may be screened multiple times a day.
An auditoum has a definite number of seats.
While booking, we can reserve one or more seats.
The seats are reserved only for the screening.

The booking flow is as such :
1) Select seats for the screening
2) Block seats for 2 mins while the payment is completed
3) Upon completion of payment, seats are reserved and tickets are allocated for seats to user.

Q) Discuss the high level architecture or component architecture for the problem.
ALso keep in mind the scale of the problem.

Youâ€™re given an array of integers. You need to find if there exists a triplet of indices (i, j, k) s.t:
  >  i < j < k
  >  a[i] < a[k] < a[j]

https://leetcode.com/problems/sliding-window-maximum/
  - Keep a deque of size K (window size)
  - This deque moves through the array and records min till that index for corresponding every cell in the deque
  - every time it moves it removes an element and adds the new element
  - output at every index is the rightmost deque value

Principles
===========

https://medium.com/the-glitcher/clean-code-principles-and-software-engineering-principles-651cdcd67fcd

DRY — Don’t Repeat Yourself. Opposite is WET.
KISS — Keep It Simple Stupid.
YAGNI — You Aren’t Gonna Need It


>> SOLID principle
Single Responsibility Principle — interface, class or method ideally should do
one thing and do that well

Open-Closed Principle — Open for extension and closed for modification.
You class should have everything — closed for modification but is open for
extension through inheritance or composition.

Liskov Substitution Principle — Every subclass should be substitutable for their
parent class. This helps in reducing coupling.

Interface segregation Principle — Every class must implement the methods of the
interface it implements. This principle states that classes should not require
to implement methods which they do not require. It helps in creating more
smaller & focused interfaces.

Dependency Inversion Principle — Classes should depend only on their
abstractions, not on their implementations. The classes should not instantiating
their dependencies but they should be injected into the class.

Design Patterns
================

https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns
https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns

Common ones I use :

1) Creational

- Factory = https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/factory-design-pattern-in-java
- Builder = https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/builder-design-pattern-in-java
    {
      private members
      private constructor 
      public getters
      public static nested builder class
      public builder class construtor 
      builder class setters to set optional params that return caller object
      builder class public build() method
    }
- Object pool
- Singleton = https://www.java67.com/2015/09/thread-safe-singleton-in-java-using-double-checked-locking-pattern.html


2) Structural
- Adapter
  - https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/adapter-design-pattern-java
- Proxy
  - https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/proxy-design-pattern


3) Behavioral
- Observer
  - https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/observer-design-pattern-in-java
- Strategy
  - https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/strategy-design-pattern-in-java-example-tutorial
- Chain of Responsibility
  - https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/chain-of-responsibility-design-pattern-in-java
- Decorator 
  - https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/decorator-design-pattern-in-java-example
